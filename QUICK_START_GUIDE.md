**Bad:** Defining 10+ activities  
**Good:** Focus on 5 core activities

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Unmeasurable KPIs
**Bad:** "Customer satisfaction" (no unit)  
**Good:** "Customer satisfaction score: 8.5/10"

**Why:** Can't manage what you can't measure

### ❌ Mistake 4: Spreading Resources Too Thin
**Bad:** 10% on each of 10 activities  
**Good:** 20% on each of 5 activities (100% total)

**Why:** Focus drives results

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Generic Processes
**Bad:** "Management meetings"
